The speedup for coarse-grain is the way it is because threads for each file need to wait for some mutex to be released before it can write the word count to the hashtable.

For each file, a thread is spawned for word count and a mutex reference is passed along to its function. A lockguard is created prior to the write operation to the hashtable - which locks the mutex and releases after the write operation is complete. (Thus ensuring no overwrites or multiple access discrepencies).


Hence, each thread needs to wait for the mutex to be released before the word count for that file that can be written to the hashtable.
